# Equation of a Line

Write a program to calculate the slope between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). The points should be entered as four floating-point values. Output should be rounded to 2 decimal places.

The formula to calculate the slope, **m**, between two points is

First, output the calculated slope value. Then, use this value to output the equation of the line in the form:

Calculate the value of **c** using one of the pairs of points entered as input. A sample input and output is shown below:

Let's find the equation of a line using 2 points.
Enter x1: **9**
Enter y1: **4**
Enter x2: **-4**
Enter y2: **7**

The slope of the line is: -0.23
The equation of the line is: y = -0.23x + 6.08
